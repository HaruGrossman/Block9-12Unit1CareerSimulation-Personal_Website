# Block9-12Unit1CareerSimulation-Personal_Website

Calliope has asked you to create a personal site with a brief bio. It is a chance to show off who you are, what you are about, and what you have accomplished. 

You will get the chance to revisit this project as we learn new techniques, so do not worry about perfecting it during your first pass. The goal here is to practice writing semantic HTML and basic CSS while following a typical industry workflow with GitHub.

üè† Home Page 
The landing page is your first impression. You can include a photo, your mission statement, and something which defines you. In our example, we have included a quote.

üë§ About Page
An about page is a place for people to get to know you. You should include your interests, and things you are good at, and in general you should pull back enough of the curtain into your life to interest a potential employer in you as a person.

üñºÔ∏è Portfolio Page
The portfolio page is the meat and potatoes of your personal site, here you want to include the projects you have worked on. For each project you wish to showcase, you should include the name of your project, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where it lives on the web.

‚úâÔ∏è Contact Page
The contact page is where potential clients and employers can reach you! This should include a form that allows visitors to your site to send you messages.

 

Note: You can use Lorem Ipsum for placeholder content, but it would be great if you included actual content!

Getting Started
You should already have a fork of the starter repoLinks to an external site.. Clone down your fork (not the starter repo).
Submit a link to your fork.
Work according to the tasks in your project board.
Remember to git commit often! You can occasionally push to sync your local clone with the repository on GitHub.
Submission
For this assignment, submit a link to your GitHub repository.
