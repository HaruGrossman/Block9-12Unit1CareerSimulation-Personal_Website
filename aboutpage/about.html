            <h2>Student, dogwalker, soldier</h2>
            <p>After graduation highschol, I attended the University of Wyoming for a single semister. At that time I
                was not fully prepared to be a collage student and dropped out.</p>
            <p>From there I joined the Army as a Human Resource Specialist working with the 3rd Special Forces Airborne,
                and 1st Special Forces Airborne. Apon leaving the Army I moved to Chicago, IL; where I started working
                as a personal dog walker and pet care provider.</p>
            <p>After falling and slipping in the ice and snow one too many times I decided it is time for me to change
                professions again. Computer programming seems like a wonderful place for me to allow my creativity to
                flex and grow. All the while keeping me safe and warm during the cold Chicago months.</p>
            <p>I still enjoy meeting puppers on daily walks. </p>
            <p>I enjoy seeing the code in everything around me. Seeing the 'loop's and the 'if else's, as people make
                decisions and cars turning at stop lights.</p>
            <p>I wonder what more I will see as I continue to learn.</p>
